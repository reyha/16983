# 16983
A modified version of [Gabriele's 2048](https://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) . 

Made just for fun. I followed Udaity's 'Make your own 2948' course for making some initial changes. [Play it here!](http://reyha.github.io/2048/)

The official app can also be found on the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gabrielecirulli.app2048) and [App Store!](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/2048-by-gabriele-cirulli/id868076805)

That screenshot is fake, by the way. I never reached 16983 :smile:
